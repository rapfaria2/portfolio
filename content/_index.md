First of all, you can see me programming a FizzBuzz using TDD (hope you don't mind the soundtrack):

Didn't even leave the keyboard!

## Current projects
* Freelance Smart Home automation using **Amazon Alexa/AWS Lambda**, **Google Home**, **Raspberry Pi**, **Python/Django**, **Android**.

* Web-development. Example: [Tem Cena Depois?](www.temcenadepois.com)
 
    List of movies that have scenes after the credits roll (so you don't miss it or don't waste time waiting for nothing).

    Made with **Python/Django**, **BeautifulSoup**, **InstaPy**, **ImageMagick**, and hosted on **DigitalOcean**'s cloud.

* On-line courses

    Launching two courses on Udemy:

    * **Tmux - Productivity on the command-line**

        How to boost productivity using tmux and it's alternatives.

    * **What's new in Python 3**

        What changed between every new major version in Python (3.X), with real-world use cases. starting with Python 3.7

    Both courses have an expected launch of early 2019


## Past projects

In the past I have built several apps, including [bots](http://www.twitter.com/tempoita), WordPress blogs, PHP backends, and many more.

The following projects are the ones that had the most interesting solutions or had several thousands of users:

* NerdCatcher: Android app for brazilian's most famous podcast, NerdCast (and it had a really cool, time-saver feature). The official app took it's place. Made for **Android**, using open-source libraries.

* TweetMute: Chrome extension to mute people without unfollowing them. Twitter structure changed heavily and quickly over time, which made development impossible. It’s still [available on github](https://github.com/rapfaria/TweetMute). Made with **JavaScript**/**jQuery**

* Feedhint: One of my most used projects, you could make highly personalized [hackerne.ws](https://news.ycombinator.com/) RSS feeds. Launched in 2011, it was also used by several companies to keep track if their company's name was mentioned in a HN comment/post. When Google took Google Reader down in 2013, that was also the end for Feedhint, as RSS usage went to free fall. Feedhint.com is now a premium domain. Made with **PHP**, **Yii**, **Varnish**, **Apache Solr**, **MySQL** (Feedhint had [great reception](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2660744) from the HN crowd)

* Booksuggest.me: Made with raw **PHP** and **PHPUnit** and TDD, you entered a book and it suggested another one that you might like. Nowadays [Goodreads](www.goodreads.com) is a much better alternative.

Besides that, I've worked as an Android developer on Motorola/Google and LG.

The full range of technologies I've used previously can be found on my resume.
